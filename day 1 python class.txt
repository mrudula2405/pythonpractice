			Python
			-------
what is Python?
----------------
Python is a General Purpose Programming Language
Python is a High-Level Programming Language
Python is a Multi-Paradigm
Python supporting both Interactive and Batch Mode Executions

		(or)

Python is a General Purpose,High-level,Interpreted,Interactive,Modular,
Dynamically Typed,Garbage Collected,Procedure Oriented,Object Oriented and Scripting Programming Language.

History of Python:
------------------
the Python was developed by the "Guido Van Rossum" in the year of 1991(actually this project immplementation is started in the year of 1989 i.e., 1980's).

the name python was derived from the Guido Van Rossum Favourite TV fun show "the complete monty python's flying circus".

currently he is working in microsoft.

he is a Dutch Programmer.

the python programming language implementation is influenced by two languages, they are

	ABC
	Modula3


Advantages of Python:
---------------------
1).Simple Syntax
	in python,there's no concept of ;,(),{}
	python simply follows Space Indentation concept.

ex: if block representation
---

	C/C++/Java			Python
	----------			--------
	if(condition)			if condition:
	{					stmt_1
	  stmt_1;				stmt_2
	    stmt_2;				......
	  ......				stmt_n
	stmt_n;
        }

2).Less Code

	python programs having lesscode when compared to other programming languages programs code like C,C++,Java,.....

ex:
---
write a C-program,to print "hello world"?

#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
  printf("hello world");
}

write a C++ program,to print "hello world"?

#include<iostream>
void main()
{
  std::cout<<"hello world";
}

write a Java program,to print "hello world"?

import java.io.*;
class Test
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
     System.out.println("hello world");
   }
}

write a Python Program,to print "hello world"?

print("hello world")

3).Dynamically typed language

ex:
---
write a C-program(Static Typed),to perform the addition operation on two different type of numerical values?

#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
  int x=10;
  float y=2.3;
  float z=x+y;
  printf("%f",z);
}


write a python-program(Dynamically typed),to perform the addition operation on two different type of numerical values?

x=10
y=2.3
z=x+y
print(z)

4).N-no.of Builtin Libraries are available


Feature's of Python:
---------------------
1).Easy-To-Read
2).Easy-To-Use
3).Easy-To-Learn
4).Easy-To-Maintain
5).CrossPlatform/Portable i.e., it support all environments
6).Scalable i.e., easily we can new features
7).Secure
8).Extandable i.e, easily extending to other programming languages
9).Flexible
10).Platform Independent i.e., write once run anywhere
11).Strongly Typed Language
12).Free and OpenSource
13).it support all types of database connections
14).Interepreted

note:
------
python is completely free and opensource project,it is maintained by PSF(Python Software Foundation) Team.

Implementations of Python  or  Distributions of Python:
------------------------       -----------------------
	the python runtime environment is implemented by using C-programming, is known as a "Cpython".

	the "Cpython" is a standard,builtin and most widely used python implementation.

	the python runtime environemnt is implemented by using Java programming, is known as a "Jython".

	the python runtime environment is implemented by using .Net languages, is known as a "IronPython".

	the python runtime environemnt is implemented by using Rust programming, is known as a "RustPython"

	the python runtime environment is implemented based embedded systems, is known as a "MicroPython/EmbeddedPython".

	the python runtime environment is implemented by Anaconda Corporation, is known as a "AnacondaPython".

	the python runtime environment is implemented by itself without using other programming stack,is known as a "StacklessPython/Stackless".

	whenever we are adding the "JIT"(Just In Time) compiler to Cpython for fatser execution,is known as a "PyPy".
